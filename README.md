# Remindur

Remindur is a full-stack web application for saving tasks. Tasks can be assigned to a particular list/category or they can be saved independently. All tasks can have a status of incomplete or complete, an optional due date and a note. This is modeled after [RememberTheMilk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/).

## Technologies

Remindur is built using Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL as a database, and Ruby's Active Record for querying the database. The frontend uses a combination of React, Redux and Vanilla JavaScript to create the user interface. Additionally, HTML5 and CSS3 were used to design the site.
